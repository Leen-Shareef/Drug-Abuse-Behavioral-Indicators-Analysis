This project focuses on analyzing behavioral indicators of drug abuse using descriptive analytics techniques. The goal is to identify patterns, trends, and correlations between various lifestyle, behavioral, and socio-economic factors that may indicate a higher risk of drug abuse. The analysis is conducted using Python, with a focus on data visualization, statistical measures, and contingency tables to extract meaningful insights. The findings are intended to support early intervention strategies for individuals at risk of drug abuse.
